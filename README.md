BiGFiles is a simple GUI tool based on Python to search your PC for big data and redirect you to it´s path folder.

Step 1:
       Open BiGFiles

Step 2:
       choose a Folder to scan

Step 3:
       enter the minimum File size you want to search for (MB)

Step 4:
       press on search.


BiGFiles will now show you the Files in this Folder which are above the MB size you entered.
It will show you the Name of the Files and the path of the files.

(optional)
you got a button which leads you directly to the folder of the selected file, you can then delete it.



why did i create this program?
- i noticed i got a lot of files on my PC but windows wouldn´t show them all on the "installed apps" page.
- i wanted to scan single folders instead of the whole harddrive since some files are not recognized by Windows, such as additional files for Games stored in different locations.
